# Progress

## Current phase
**Phase 2 (Edit engine) is COMPLETE.** All six roadmap items shipped:
exposure, contrast, white balance, curves, HSL, crop — each reviewer-approved
and manually verified live. Phase 3 (non-destructive pipeline: param
serialization, edit history, undo) is next per CLAUDE.md's roadmap, but has
NOT been started and needs its own Plan Mode session + explicit user
go-ahead — the "do it all" instruction covered Phase 2's remaining features
specifically, not an open-ended continuation into Phase 3.

## Done
### Phase 1 — Foundation (complete, verified live)
- Repo initialized, CLAUDE.md workflow rules in place (quota/safe-pause
  discipline, this PROGRESS.md file).
- Xcode project scaffolded via XcodeGen (`project.yml`); `.xcodeproj` is
  generated, gitignored, regenerate with `xcodegen generate`.
- Rendering: `MetalImageView` (MTKView, on-demand redraw) + `ImageRenderer`
  (CIContext-based draw, aspect-fit + centered) + `AspectFit` math with unit
  tests.
- UI: `ContentView` + `ImageDocumentModel` — Open… via NSOpenPanel, read-only
  file access, EXIF orientation applied, decode-failure alert.
- Golden path manually verified live: real photo opens upright, readable,
  centered. (One round-trip bug along the way: a vertical-flip "fix" validated
  only against an offline MTLTexture test actually caused 180° rotation in the
  *live* MTKView drawable; removing it fixed it — see the comment in
  `Sources/Rendering/ImageRenderer.swift` for the scoped, empirical explanation
  and the flagged re-verify-later risk for Phase 5 export / Phase 7 tiled
  rendering, which will target offscreen textures like the misleading test did.)

### Phase 2, Feature 1 — Exposure adjustment (complete, verified live)
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditState.swift` — `exposureEV`.
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditPipeline.swift` — applies exposure via Core Image's
  built-in `CIExposureAdjust`, scene-linear.
- `Sources/Rendering/ImageRenderer.swift` — `CIContext` explicitly sets
  `workingColorSpace` (extended-range linear sRGB) + `workingFormat` (`RGBAh`),
  satisfying CLAUDE.md's "linear light in a defined working color space"
  instead of relying on framework defaults; output stays sRGB, applied only at
  final render. `draw(in:)` applies the edit pipeline and uses the *edited*
  image's extent throughout (forward-compatible with crop).
- Exposure slider (bottom bar, −5…+5 EV); edit state resets per photo on load.
- Reviewer-approved; user manually confirmed live.

### Phase 2, Feature 2 — Contrast adjustment (complete, verified live)
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditState.swift` — `contrast` (-1...1, maps to
  `CIColorControls` factor `1 + contrast`).
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditPipeline.swift` — contrast is applied in the
  **perceptual sRGB-gamma domain, not linear light** — a documented deviation
  from CLAUDE.md's default rule (which CLAUDE.md permits when documented).
  Rationale: a linear-domain pivot at 0.5 sits at ~0.735 perceptual
  brightness, crushing photographic middle gray (linear ≈0.214) toward black
  at typical contrast factors — empirically verified against real
  `CIColorControls` behavior before implementing. Implementation:
  `CIColorControls` sandwiched between `CILinearToSRGBToneCurve` (encode) and
  `CISRGBToneCurveToLinear` (decode), applied after exposure. The tone-curve
  filters are exact inverses and don't clamp values >1, so exposure's
  highlight headroom survives the round-trip. This encode/decode boundary
  (`applyPerceptualAdjustments`) is a **shared sandwich** — curves and HSL
  must be added *inside* it, not given their own.
- Contrast slider (bottom bar, -1...1, live % readout).
- 8 contrast tests; values independently re-derived by the reviewer from the
  stated sRGB transfer functions, confirmed correct to ~2e-6.
- Reviewer-approved; user manually confirmed live.

### Phase 2, Feature 3 — White balance (temperature + tint) (complete, verified live)
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditState.swift` — `whiteBalanceTemperature` (Kelvin,
  3500...9500, default 6500 = neutral) and `whiteBalanceTint` (-100...100,
  default 0).
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditPipeline.swift` — WB is first in the pipeline
  (`applyWhiteBalance` runs before `applyExposure`), applied in **scene-linear
  light — NOT a deviation** (unlike contrast), since chromatic adaptation is
  physically a linear matrix multiply. Empirically confirmed via real
  `CITemperatureAndTint` behavior: identity round-trips exactly, values >1.0
  stay finite/un-clamped.
- **Two composed sign inversions**, both measured not assumed: (1) the raw
  Core Image filter's own semantics run opposite to intuition (lower
  `targetNeutral.x` = warmer; negative `targetNeutral.y` = magenta); (2) mid-session
  the user asked to switch the Temperature UI from a relative scale to actual
  Kelvin, which required a SECOND inversion to match the Lightroom/Camera Raw
  convention (higher Kelvin slider = warmer on screen — itself backwards from
  both blackbody physics and the raw filter). Final mapping:
  `targetNeutral.x = 2*6500 - whiteBalanceTemperature`. Verified: 6500K → exact
  filter neutral (true identity), 9500K → the measured "warm" filter input,
  3500K → the measured "cool" one. Reviewer independently verified this
  composition arithmetically (not just self-consistency) after the pivot,
  including checking for leftover old-scale (`-100...100`/default-`0`)
  remnants — none found.
- Temperature slider now shows Kelvin directly (`"%.0fK"`, 3500...9500,
  resets to 6500); Tint slider unchanged (-100...100, resets to 0).
- 10 new WB tests using values measured from the real filter (chromatic
  adaptation has no closed-form transfer function to hand-derive against).
- All 31 tests pass (6 AspectFit + 25 EditPipeline); 2 commits (color-math,
  then UI); user manually confirmed live, including after the Kelvin pivot —
  dragging Temperature right visibly warms the photo, matching Lightroom.

### Phase 2, Feature 4 — Curves (parametric shadows/highlights) (complete, verified live)
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditState.swift` — `curvesShadows`, `curvesHighlights`
  (both -1...1, default 0), added after `contrast`.
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditPipeline.swift` — curves runs inside the existing
  perceptual sandwich, **after contrast** (measured non-commutative: reversed
  order gives a different result for the same inputs — 0.84872 vs 1.59067 at
  one test point). Scoped as two sliders (Highlights, Shadows) each moving one
  control point of Core Image's `CIToneCurve` (a 5-point spline), matching
  Lightroom's simplified Basic-panel tone controls rather than a full
  interactive point-based curve editor — consistent scope with every other
  Phase 2 feature.
- **Known, measured, documented limitation**: `CIToneCurve` clamps its domain
  to [0,1] the moment it's non-identity, so enabling any curve adjustment
  collapses highlight headroom above linear 1.0 — including headroom contrast
  alone would otherwise preserve — to white. Confirmed via diagnostic script,
  independently re-confirmed by the reviewer, who also stress-tested the
  obvious "cheap" workaround (split off headroom, curve only the safe range,
  recombine) and found it **silently corrupts alpha** via premultiplication
  math — concretely validating that shipping the clamp as a documented v1
  limitation and deferring a custom Metal kernel (per CLAUDE.md's Stack note:
  "custom kernels for curves, HSL, WB") is the right tradeoff, not a shortcut.
  Two tests (`testCurvesClampHighlightHeadroom`,
  `testContrastHeadroomLostWhenCurveActive`) pin this as an intentional
  regression guard, not just documentation.
- Highlights/Shadows sliders (bottom bar, -1...1, live % readout), after
  Contrast.
- 10 new curves tests using values measured from the real filter (chromatic
  spline behavior has no closed-form transfer function to hand-derive
  against). All 40 tests pass (6 AspectFit + 34 EditPipeline); 2 commits
  (color-math, then UI); user manually confirmed live — both sliders produce
  visible, monotonic, controllable tonal shaping.

### Phase 2, Feature 5 — HSL (global hue + saturation) (complete, verified live)
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditState.swift` — `hslHue` (-180...180°, default 0) and
  `hslSaturation` (-1...1, default 0), added after `curvesHighlights`.
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditPipeline.swift` — HSL runs inside the perceptual
  sandwich, **after curves** (measured non-commutative, like contrast↔curves).
  Scoped as two sliders (global Hue, global Saturation) rather than a
  per-color-band professional HSL panel (8 bands × 3 params — an order of
  magnitude more surface with no analog in anything shipped). Lightness
  intentionally omitted: would duplicate exposure + curves' shadow/highlight
  lift (same reasoning curves used to skip a midtones slider).
- **Headline finding, verified not assumed**: unlike curves, HSL does NOT
  clamp highlight headroom — `CIHueAdjust` and `CIColorControls.saturation`
  are matrix/blend ops with no internal [0,1] LUT (measured: saturation +1 on
  a 1.4 channel → 2.57770, not clamped). Confirms the curves plan's own
  warning not to blindly repeat its clamp precedent for HSL. Hue's raw
  rotation direction already matched on-screen intuition — no sign inversion
  needed (unlike white balance's two).
- **A first reviewer pass caught a real gap**: the initial claim "hue and
  saturation commute" only held at modest slider values, untested at the
  actual slider range, where the two measurably diverge (~0.0043 at hue
  -90°/sat +1, over 2x the test tolerance) even though the shipped order is
  fixed. Fixed by correcting the doc comment and adding
  `testHueSaturationOrderIsFixed` as a real regression guard — the reviewer
  verified this by temporarily reversing the code's internal order and
  confirming the test failed with the exact predicted values, then restoring
  it.
- Hue/Saturation sliders (bottom bar, after Shadows).
- 9 new HSL tests (+1 from the review fix = 10) using values measured from
  the real filters. All 49 tests pass (6 AspectFit + 43 EditPipeline); 2
  commits (color-math + fix, then UI); user manually confirmed live — hue
  rotates colors around the wheel, saturation ranges grayscale to punchier.

### Phase 2, Feature 6 — Crop (final Phase 2 feature) (complete, verified live)
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditState.swift` — `cropInsetTop`/`Bottom`/`Left`/`Right`
  (all 0...0.45, default 0), added after `hslSaturation`. Struct does NOT
  itself enforce the range (documented) — `EditPipeline` clamps on every use.
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditPipeline.swift` — `applyCrop` is the final pipeline
  stage, after the perceptual sandwich (pure geometry, no color-space
  concerns — unlike every other Phase 2 feature). Unlike those features, this
  plan was designed directly rather than via a dispatched Plan agent (given
  this session hit a spend limit once already, and crop's risk profile is
  much lower — close analog to `AspectFit`, no Core Image diagnostics needed).
  Coordinate-direction claim ("top inset" trims the high-y portion of
  `CIImage`'s coordinate space) was verified empirically before writing code,
  then pinned with unit tests using a quadrant-colored synthetic image rather
  than just extent-number checks.
- **A real bug was found and fixed during live manual testing** (not caught
  by any unit test, since it's a live-rendering-only artifact): dragging the
  crop sliders continuously produced repeated/tiled strips of the image
  instead of a clean single crop. Root cause: `ImageRenderer.draw(in:)`
  renders directly into `drawable.texture`, bypassing MTKView's normal clear
  pass; before crop, the fitted image always filled at least one full
  dimension of the drawable, so uncovered margins never mattered. Crop is the
  first stage that can shrink the fitted image on both axes at once, and
  MTKView's buffered drawables retained stale content from earlier frames of
  the same drag in those margins. Fixed by compositing the fitted image over
  an explicit full-bounds black background every frame
  (`Sources/Rendering/ImageRenderer.swift`). Verified live after the fix —
  clean single crop, correct on all four sides. Reviewer confirmed the fix is
  sound and color-space-invariant, noted a cheaper hardware-clear alternative
  exists but isn't necessary before Phase 7's perf work.
- Four crop inset sliders (bottom bar, last of 12 total rows — the control
  panel is now wrapped in a `ScrollView` to stay usable).
- 8 new crop tests, including a quadrant-image coordinate-direction proof.
  All 57 tests pass (6 AspectFit + 51 EditPipeline); 3 commits (crop
  color/geometry math, the rendering fix as its own commit, then UI).
- 24 commits total on `master`.

## In progress / blocked
Nothing blocked. Nice-to-have not yet eyeballed (low risk, not required):
window-resize re-fit behavior, opened-file mtime check.

## Exact next step
**Phase 2 is done.** Do not start Phase 3 (non-destructive pipeline: param
serialization, edit history, undo) without the user's explicit go-ahead — the
"do it all" instruction this session was scoped to Phase 2's remaining
features specifically, and starting a new phase always needs its own Plan
Mode session per CLAUDE.md's roadmap-order rule regardless.

**Patterns worth carrying into Phase 3 and beyond:**
- This project hit "verify the sign/direction/behavior empirically, don't
  assume" as a load-bearing pattern SIX times across Phase 2 (y-flip,
  contrast pivot, WB signs ×2, curves clamping, HSL commutativity, and now
  the crop coordinate-direction check that was verified proactively and
  passed). Keep defaulting to diagnostic scripts/live testing over
  documentation-reading or intuition for anything with coordinate, sign, or
  GPU-buffering semantics.
- **Not every bug is caught by unit tests** — the crop tiling bug was a
  live-rendering-only artifact (multi-frame GPU buffer staleness) invisible
  to any offscreen test, including the project's own established
  offscreen-diagnostic technique. Manual live verification (the "drag
  continuously, not just single clicks" step) is what caught it. Keep doing
  real interactive testing, not just static single-state checks, for any
  future rendering-path change.
- When delegating empirical work to a spawned Plan-type agent, it will very
  likely need an explicit reminder that Plan Mode's read-only restriction
  applies to the top-level orchestrating agent, not to it — this happened
  twice (white balance, HSL) and cost a full extra round-trip both times.
  Front-load that reminder in the initial prompt, not just after it
  hesitates.
- Not every feature needs a dispatched Plan agent — crop was designed
  directly given its low, well-understood risk profile and this session's
  spend-limit sensitivity. Use judgment: color-math/domain questions need
  empirical Plan-agent investigation; pure-geometry or already-established
  patterns (like `AspectFit`) don't.

## Open reviewer issues
None outstanding — last reviewer verdict was APPROVE (crop feature + the
rendering fix, Phase 2 Feature 6 — the final Phase 2 feature).
