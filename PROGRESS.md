# Progress

## Current phase
Phase 2 — Edit engine: exposure, contrast, white balance, and curves done;
HSL, crop not yet started. User has requested all remaining Phase 2 features
be done sequentially in this session, each with full rigor (Plan Mode +
empirical color-math verification where needed + tests + reviewer + commit) —
this is a deliberate, explicit override of "one feature per session," not an
oversight.

## Done
### Phase 1 — Foundation (complete, verified live)
- Repo initialized, CLAUDE.md workflow rules in place (quota/safe-pause
  discipline, this PROGRESS.md file).
- Xcode project scaffolded via XcodeGen (`project.yml`); `.xcodeproj` is
  generated, gitignored, regenerate with `xcodegen generate`.
- Rendering: `MetalImageView` (MTKView, on-demand redraw) + `ImageRenderer`
  (CIContext-based draw, aspect-fit + centered) + `AspectFit` math with unit
  tests.
- UI: `ContentView` + `ImageDocumentModel` — Open… via NSOpenPanel, read-only
  file access, EXIF orientation applied, decode-failure alert.
- Golden path manually verified live: real photo opens upright, readable,
  centered. (One round-trip bug along the way: a vertical-flip "fix" validated
  only against an offline MTLTexture test actually caused 180° rotation in the
  *live* MTKView drawable; removing it fixed it — see the comment in
  `Sources/Rendering/ImageRenderer.swift` for the scoped, empirical explanation
  and the flagged re-verify-later risk for Phase 5 export / Phase 7 tiled
  rendering, which will target offscreen textures like the misleading test did.)

### Phase 2, Feature 1 — Exposure adjustment (complete, verified live)
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditState.swift` — `exposureEV`.
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditPipeline.swift` — applies exposure via Core Image's
  built-in `CIExposureAdjust`, scene-linear.
- `Sources/Rendering/ImageRenderer.swift` — `CIContext` explicitly sets
  `workingColorSpace` (extended-range linear sRGB) + `workingFormat` (`RGBAh`),
  satisfying CLAUDE.md's "linear light in a defined working color space"
  instead of relying on framework defaults; output stays sRGB, applied only at
  final render. `draw(in:)` applies the edit pipeline and uses the *edited*
  image's extent throughout (forward-compatible with crop).
- Exposure slider (bottom bar, −5…+5 EV); edit state resets per photo on load.
- Reviewer-approved; user manually confirmed live.

### Phase 2, Feature 2 — Contrast adjustment (complete, verified live)
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditState.swift` — `contrast` (-1...1, maps to
  `CIColorControls` factor `1 + contrast`).
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditPipeline.swift` — contrast is applied in the
  **perceptual sRGB-gamma domain, not linear light** — a documented deviation
  from CLAUDE.md's default rule (which CLAUDE.md permits when documented).
  Rationale: a linear-domain pivot at 0.5 sits at ~0.735 perceptual
  brightness, crushing photographic middle gray (linear ≈0.214) toward black
  at typical contrast factors — empirically verified against real
  `CIColorControls` behavior before implementing. Implementation:
  `CIColorControls` sandwiched between `CILinearToSRGBToneCurve` (encode) and
  `CISRGBToneCurveToLinear` (decode), applied after exposure. The tone-curve
  filters are exact inverses and don't clamp values >1, so exposure's
  highlight headroom survives the round-trip. This encode/decode boundary
  (`applyPerceptualAdjustments`) is a **shared sandwich** — curves and HSL
  must be added *inside* it, not given their own.
- Contrast slider (bottom bar, -1...1, live % readout).
- 8 contrast tests; values independently re-derived by the reviewer from the
  stated sRGB transfer functions, confirmed correct to ~2e-6.
- Reviewer-approved; user manually confirmed live.

### Phase 2, Feature 3 — White balance (temperature + tint) (complete, verified live)
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditState.swift` — `whiteBalanceTemperature` (Kelvin,
  3500...9500, default 6500 = neutral) and `whiteBalanceTint` (-100...100,
  default 0).
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditPipeline.swift` — WB is first in the pipeline
  (`applyWhiteBalance` runs before `applyExposure`), applied in **scene-linear
  light — NOT a deviation** (unlike contrast), since chromatic adaptation is
  physically a linear matrix multiply. Empirically confirmed via real
  `CITemperatureAndTint` behavior: identity round-trips exactly, values >1.0
  stay finite/un-clamped.
- **Two composed sign inversions**, both measured not assumed: (1) the raw
  Core Image filter's own semantics run opposite to intuition (lower
  `targetNeutral.x` = warmer; negative `targetNeutral.y` = magenta); (2) mid-session
  the user asked to switch the Temperature UI from a relative scale to actual
  Kelvin, which required a SECOND inversion to match the Lightroom/Camera Raw
  convention (higher Kelvin slider = warmer on screen — itself backwards from
  both blackbody physics and the raw filter). Final mapping:
  `targetNeutral.x = 2*6500 - whiteBalanceTemperature`. Verified: 6500K → exact
  filter neutral (true identity), 9500K → the measured "warm" filter input,
  3500K → the measured "cool" one. Reviewer independently verified this
  composition arithmetically (not just self-consistency) after the pivot,
  including checking for leftover old-scale (`-100...100`/default-`0`)
  remnants — none found.
- Temperature slider now shows Kelvin directly (`"%.0fK"`, 3500...9500,
  resets to 6500); Tint slider unchanged (-100...100, resets to 0).
- 10 new WB tests using values measured from the real filter (chromatic
  adaptation has no closed-form transfer function to hand-derive against).
- All 31 tests pass (6 AspectFit + 25 EditPipeline); 2 commits (color-math,
  then UI); user manually confirmed live, including after the Kelvin pivot —
  dragging Temperature right visibly warms the photo, matching Lightroom.

### Phase 2, Feature 4 — Curves (parametric shadows/highlights) (complete, verified live)
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditState.swift` — `curvesShadows`, `curvesHighlights`
  (both -1...1, default 0), added after `contrast`.
- `Sources/EditEngine/EditPipeline.swift` — curves runs inside the existing
  perceptual sandwich, **after contrast** (measured non-commutative: reversed
  order gives a different result for the same inputs — 0.84872 vs 1.59067 at
  one test point). Scoped as two sliders (Highlights, Shadows) each moving one
  control point of Core Image's `CIToneCurve` (a 5-point spline), matching
  Lightroom's simplified Basic-panel tone controls rather than a full
  interactive point-based curve editor — consistent scope with every other
  Phase 2 feature.
- **Known, measured, documented limitation**: `CIToneCurve` clamps its domain
  to [0,1] the moment it's non-identity, so enabling any curve adjustment
  collapses highlight headroom above linear 1.0 — including headroom contrast
  alone would otherwise preserve — to white. Confirmed via diagnostic script,
  independently re-confirmed by the reviewer, who also stress-tested the
  obvious "cheap" workaround (split off headroom, curve only the safe range,
  recombine) and found it **silently corrupts alpha** via premultiplication
  math — concretely validating that shipping the clamp as a documented v1
  limitation and deferring a custom Metal kernel (per CLAUDE.md's Stack note:
  "custom kernels for curves, HSL, WB") is the right tradeoff, not a shortcut.
  Two tests (`testCurvesClampHighlightHeadroom`,
  `testContrastHeadroomLostWhenCurveActive`) pin this as an intentional
  regression guard, not just documentation.
- Highlights/Shadows sliders (bottom bar, -1...1, live % readout), after
  Contrast.
- 10 new curves tests using values measured from the real filter (chromatic
  spline behavior has no closed-form transfer function to hand-derive
  against). All 40 tests pass (6 AspectFit + 34 EditPipeline); 2 commits
  (color-math, then UI); user manually confirmed live — both sliders produce
  visible, monotonic, controllable tonal shaping.
- 18 commits total on `master`.

## In progress / blocked
Nothing blocked. Nice-to-have not yet eyeballed (low risk, not required):
window-resize re-fit behavior, opened-file mtime check.

## Exact next step
**Continuing directly to HSL** (per the user's "do it all, sequentially, full
rigor" instruction — no need to re-ask before starting it). After HSL: crop.

**Important architectural notes carried forward:**
- The perceptual sandwich (`applyPerceptualAdjustments` in
  `Sources/EditEngine/EditPipeline.swift`) now guards on
  `contrast != 0 || curvesActive(state)` — HSL must extend this further
  (`|| hslActive(state)`) and apply itself conditionally inside (the
  established per-stage-`if` pattern), not build its own sandwich.
- **HSL will likely inherit the same [0,1] clamp** if it uses a stock filter
  in the same sandwich — but the "ship stock, document, defer the kernel"
  precedent from curves should be re-evaluated, not blindly repeated: a
  saturation boost on bright highlights more plausibly *wants* headroom than
  a tone curve does. Verify empirically what HSL's actual filter does before
  deciding.
- Reuse the "find a non-commuting case to prove pipeline position" test
  pattern (worked for WB↔contrast and contrast↔curves) for HSL's own ordering
  test against curves.
- This project has now hit "verify the sign/direction/behavior empirically,
  don't assume" as a load-bearing pattern four times (y-flip, contrast pivot,
  WB signs ×2, curves clamping) — keep defaulting to diagnostic scripts over
  documentation-reading or intuition for any new filter.

## Open reviewer issues
None outstanding — last reviewer verdict was APPROVE (curves feature, Phase 2
Feature 4; reviewer independently reproduced all measured test values and
stress-tested the clamp-avoidance alternative before approving).
