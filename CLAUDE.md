# Photo Editor (Lightroom-style) — Project Memory

## What this project is
A native macOS photo editor with a library/catalog, in the spirit of Lightroom.
Non-destructive editing is the core invariant: **original files are never modified**.
Edits are stored as parameter sets and rendered live on the GPU.

## Stack
- Swift + SwiftUI (AppKit interop where needed)
- Metal / Core Image for the GPU edit pipeline (custom kernels for curves, HSL, WB)
- SQLite via GRDB for the catalog (photos, edits, collections, ratings)
- LibRaw via C++ interop for RAW decoding (Phase 6 — do not start early)
- Xcode project is generated from `project.yml` via XcodeGen (`brew install xcodegen`,
  then `xcodegen generate`); the `.xcodeproj` itself is gitignored and regenerable.
- Build/test from CLI: `xcodegen generate && xcodebuild -scheme PhotoApp build` /
  `xcodebuild -scheme PhotoApp test` (scheme: PhotoApp)

## Architecture principles
- Non-destructive: edit state = ordered list of adjustment params, serialized to the DB
  (and optionally XMP-style sidecars). Replaying the same params must be deterministic.
- Edit pipeline order is fixed: decode → WB → exposure → contrast → curves → HSL → transform/distort → crop → output transform.
- All image math in linear light in a defined working color space; convert to display/sRGB only at output. Document any deviation.
- DB access never blocks the main thread. Thumbnails generate on a background queue.
- Keep modules separated: Catalog / EditEngine / Rendering / UI. No UI imports in EditEngine.

## Roadmap (build strictly in this order)
1. Foundation: Xcode project, open + display an image in a Metal-backed view
2. Edit engine: exposure, contrast, white balance, curves, HSL, crop, transform/distort
   — see detailed backlog below (grown from the original 6 items after review)
3. Non-destructive pipeline: param serialization, edit history, undo
4. Library: import, catalog DB, thumbnail grid, ratings/flags, collections
5. Presets + export: save/apply presets, batch export (resize, quality, format)
6. RAW support: LibRaw bridge, demosaic, camera profiles
7. Polish: tiled rendering for large images, perf, edge cases

One feature per session. Do not start a later phase while an earlier one has open issues.

### Phase 2 edit engine backlog
Grouped to match Apple Photos' adjustment panel (used 2026-07-31 as a reference for
completeness — a mature, shipping editor's full control set). ✅ = shipped (v1, may be
a simplified version — see note); everything else is not built yet. Pick ONE at a time,
each gets its own Plan Mode session per the workflow rules below.

- **Light (tone):** Exposure ✅, Contrast ✅, Brightness ✅ (additive lightness,
  distinct from Exposure's multiplicative linear-light gain, applied in the
  perceptual domain), Black Point ✅ (shadow clipping point, implemented by
  moving Curves' point0 along its X axis), Brilliance ✅ (this app's own
  composite approximation — NOT Apple's proprietary algorithm — a render-time
  blend of effective contrast/shadow-lift/highlight-protection/saturation).
  Shadows/Highlights currently live under Curves v1 below rather than as dedicated
  Light-group sliders — revisit whether to split them out once Levels/Curves v2 lands.
- **Color:** Saturation ✅ (global, under HSL v1 below), Vibrance ✅ (saturation
  that protects already-saturated tones and skin tones — a genuinely different
  algorithm from plain saturation, via Core Image's `CIVibrance`). Not built:
  Cast (color-cast neutralization, distinct from White Balance's temperature/tint).
- **Black & White:** not built — monochrome conversion mode.
- **Red-Eye:** not built — likely needs a point-and-click UI, a different interaction
  model from every slider-based adjustment built so far.
- **White Balance:** Temperature + Tint ✅. Not built: "pick a neutral gray" eyedropper.
- **Curves:** ✅ v1 shipped as simplified parametric Shadows/Highlights sliders (2
  control points of a `CIToneCurve` spline — known limitation: clamps highlight
  headroom above linear 1.0 when active, see `EditPipeline.applyCurves`). v2 not built:
  full interactive draggable RGB point-curve editor.
- **Levels:** not built — black-point/white-point/gamma sliders with a live histogram;
  distinct tool from Curves despite overlapping purpose.
- **Definition (Clarity):** not built — local-contrast enhancement.
- **Selective Color:** this is HSL v2 — per-color-band Hue/Saturation/Luminance panel
  with a Range parameter (8 bands × 3 = 24 params), not yet built (v1 below is
  global-only).
- **HSL:** ✅ v1 shipped as global Hue + Saturation sliders (no Lightness — would
  duplicate Exposure/Curves). v2 = Selective Color above.
- **Noise Reduction:** not built.
- **Sharpen:** not built — parametric (Intensity/Edges/Falloff-style).
- **Vignette:** ✅ Strength + Radius shipped (via Core Image's `CIVignetteEffect`,
  centered on the post-crop extent so it correctly follows a crop). Softness
  (falloff) not built — fixed at a measured constant for now.
- **Transform/Distort:** not built — refined against Apple Photos' Crop panel
  (2026-07-31 reference): Straighten (rotation angle, degrees), Vertical and Horizontal
  perspective/keystone correction (two independent axes, not one combined "distort"
  control), lens distortion correction. Geometric like crop; runs before crop in the
  fixed pipeline order (see Architecture principles above).
- **Flip:** ✅ shipped — two independent toggles mirroring horizontal/vertical around
  the image's own extent center, as a new Transform/Distort stage before crop.
- **Crop:** ✅ v1 shipped as four numeric inset sliders (Top/Bottom/Left/Right). ✅ v2's
  interactive drag-handle crop rectangle also shipped (overlaid on the full image, 8
  handles + interior drag, numeric sliders kept and stay in sync). Not built: aspect-ratio
  presets, concretely (from the same reference): Original, Freeform, Square, 16:9, 4:5,
  5:7, 4:3, 3:5, 3:2, Custom. Straighten/Vertical/Horizontal live under Transform/Distort
  above, not duplicated here, even though Photos surfaces them in the same Crop panel.

## Workflow rules (important)
- Model is `opusplan`: ALWAYS enter Plan Mode before starting a new feature so the
  plan is produced by the stronger model. Keep plans scoped to ONE feature.
- After completing a feature and BEFORE any git commit, invoke the `reviewer` agent
  on the diff (`git diff HEAD`).
- If the reviewer verdict is FIX FIRST: fix every listed issue, then re-run the
  reviewer. Only commit on APPROVE.
- Never commit shader or color-math changes without a reviewer pass.
- Write unit tests for all edit math (curves interpolation, WB scaling, color
  conversions) — these are cheap to test and expensive to debug visually.
- Commit small and often, one logical change per commit, imperative commit messages.
- Build and run tests via xcodebuild after every significant change; fix failures
  before moving on.

## Quota / safe-pause discipline
The subscription can hit a usage limit and end the session at any moment. You
cannot see the exact remaining quota, so assume a cutoff could happen after any
step and make every stopping point safe:
- Keep `PROGRESS.md` at the repo root always current. After finishing any feature
  or before a long-running task, update it with: current phase, what's done, what's
  in progress, the exact next step, and any open reviewer issues.
- Work in small committed increments so no more than one small unit of work is ever
  uncommitted. A hard cutoff should never lose more than a few minutes.
- If the user says they are near their limit, or asks you to pause: immediately
  commit work-in-progress on a branch, update PROGRESS.md, summarize where things
  stand and the exact resume command, then stop — do not start new work.
- To resume in a new session: read PROGRESS.md first, then continue from its
  "next step".

### Conserving quota (make the subscription last)
- Reserve the stronger model for planning only (opusplan already does this). Don't
  ask for Opus-level reasoning on routine implementation.
- Run `/clear` between features so context doesn't accumulate — large context is
  the main driver of token burn.
- Keep plans and diffs scoped to one feature; avoid re-reading the whole codebase
  when a targeted Grep/Read will do.
- The reviewer agent only reads diffs, not the full tree — keep it that way.

## Conventions
- Swift: SwiftLint defaults, no force-unwraps outside tests, `// MARK:` sections.
- Shaders live in `Sources/Rendering/Shaders/`, one kernel per file, commented with
  the math they implement and its source/reference.
- DB migrations are append-only, in `Sources/Catalog/Migrations/`.
